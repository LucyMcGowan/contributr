### Some Rules

***

- Don't start working on an issue before being assigned to it. Express your interest in the issue thread. 
- Be reliable, if you get assigned to an issue do it in a timely manner and respond to comments timely too.
- It might be helpful to write your due dates so that the maintainer knows when to hear back from you.
- Don't break the package, continuous integration builds should not fail for your Pull request.
- Have fun!
